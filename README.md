# Hello-world

Critian here, im a real estate professional, coffee additct, self proclaimed workaholic that's new to the coding world.

I'm planning to learn the skills necessary to create financial instruments that could help investors accurately determine their best options, both in the real estate world and stock brokerage world. 

Would also like to learn to make games as a hobby.
